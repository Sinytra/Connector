## üìñ About

**Sinytra Connector** is a translation/compatibility layer that allows running [Fabric](https://fabricmc.net) mods
on [MinecraftForge](https://minecraftforge.net). Its goal is to bring the two platforms closer together, saving
developers time and effort maintaining their mods for multiple platforms at once, as well as allowing players to play
all their favourite mods in one modpack.

### Recommendations

- Visit the [Mod Compatibility Thread](https://github.com/Sinytra/Connector/discussions/12) to can find information about known working / incompatible mods
- To learn more about how Connector works, read our [Introductory blog post](https://github.com/Sinytra/Connector/discussions/11)
- Developing cross-platform mods? Check out the [Forgified Fabric API](https://github.com/Sinytra/ForgifiedFabricAPI), a port of the Fabric API to Forge
- Install [Connector Extras](https://github.com/Sinytra/ConnectorExtras) for improved compatibility with third-party libraries and APIs
- If you're using Embeddium with Fabric mods installed, also install [Lazurite](https://modrinth.com/mod/lazurite) for proper FRAPI compatibility

- Engage in the project's development and collaborate with our team
- ... and just hang out with the rest of our community.

## üìã Usage Guide

To install Connector and its dependencies, follow the same installation steps as you would for any other mods:

1. Install **Minecraft Forge**. For Minecraft 1.20.1, it is recommended to use version **`47.1.3`**.  
[\[Minecraft Forge website\]](https://files.minecraftforge.net)
2. Install **Connector**. Get the latest release from one of our official distribution channels and drop the jar in your mods folder.  
[\[CurseForge\]](https://legacy.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/sinytra-connector) [\[Modrinth\]](https://modrinth.com/mod/connector) [\[GitHub\]](https://github.com/Sinytra/Connector/releases)
4. Download the **Forgified Fabric API**.
   It is meant to be a direct *replacement* for the Fabric API and is not compatible with it.
   We'll try our best to avoid loading the Fabric API if it's installed automatically (e.g.
   by your modpack manager), but if you have the option to avoid installing it, please do so.  
[\[CurseForge\]](https://legacy.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/forgified-fabric-api) [\[Modrinth\]](https://modrinth.com/mod/forgified-fabric-api) [\[GitHub\]](https://github.com/Sinytra/ForgifiedFabricAPI/releases/latest)
5. You're good to go! With all dependencies installed, grab your favourite Fabric mods and
   **just drop them in the mods folder** like you would with any Forge mods. Connector will handle loading them for you
   with no additional steps required.

## üîç Get help

If you're having trouble running a mod on Connector, join our community on [Discord](https://discord.gg/mamk7z3TKZ), ask us
on [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/Sinytra/Connector/discussions) or open an issue in this repository.

Here's a few tips to follow when reporting issues:

1. Make sure you are using latest available version. Look for existing issues that might've already been answered /
   fixed. Think about whether the issue is caused by Connector itself and not another mod you've installed. To test
   this, try reproducing the same issue on Fabric.
2. Navigate to [the issues tab](https://github.com/Sinytra/Connector/issues) and open
   a [new issue](https://github.com/Sinytra/Connector/issues/new/choose). Select one of the available templates
   depending on the topic. Fill in the required fields. In order to increase our chances of identifying and reproducing
   the issue, please make sure to include as many details as possible.
3. Once you're done describing the problem, submit the issue. We'll get to you as soon as we can.

Please note that providing as many details as possible is crucial to help us find and resolve the issue faster, while
also getting you a fixed version ASAP.

* Use the file you are editing as a style guide.
* Make sure your feature isn't already in the works, or hasn't been rejected previously.

## üõ†Ô∏è Developer guide

If you're a mod developer and you'd like to run Connector in your dev environment, it is possible in just a few steps.

1. You need to have [MixinGradle](https://github.com/SpongePowered/MixinGradle) installed for mixins to be remapped
   properly.
2. Fabric mods must be in `intermediary` mappings at runtime.

#### Gradle Usage

```groovy
repositories {
    maven {
        name = "Sinytra"
        url = "https://maven.su5ed.dev/releases"
    }
}
dependencies {
    // Add Connector to the launch classpath
    minecraftLibrary fg.deobf("dev.su5ed.sinytra:Connector:<version>")
    // Add FFAPI dependency (if required)
    runtimeOnly fg.deobf("dev.su5ed.sinytra.fabric-api:fabric-api:<version>")
    // Install desired Fabric mods 
    implementation "some.fabric:mod:<version>"
}
// Attach clean minecraft artifact path to runs, necessary for Connector to work
afterEvaluate {
    def cleanArtifactJar = Objects.requireNonNull(net.minecraftforge.gradle.common.util.MavenArtifactDownloader.generate(project, "net.minecraft:joined:${project.MCP_VERSION}:srg", true), "Cannot find clean minecraft artifact")
    minecraft.runs.configureEach {
        property("connector.clean.path", cleanArtifactJar)
    }
}
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

### Global Mod Aliases

To improve mod compatibility, Connector provides a Global Mod Alias feature that can be used to provide alternative IDs
for mods in the fabric loader. Similar to fabric's [Dependency Overrides](https://fabricmc.net/wiki/tutorial:dependency_overrides),
it uses a json config file to define aliases.

Global Mod Aliases are defined in a file named `connector_global_mod_aliases.json`, located inside your config folder.
If it doesn't exist yet, Connector will create a new one with its default mod aliases.

Here's a minimal configuration example:
```json
{
   "version": 1,
   "aliases": {
      "cloth_config": "cloth-config2",
      "embeddium": [
         "sodium",
         "magnesium"
      ]
   }
}
```

Let's go over it line-by-line.
- First, we have `version`, which specifies the config file spec version we would like to use.
  At the time of writing, the latest version is version 1.
- Secondly, we have `aliases`. This JSON object contains all of our alises for various mods.  
  Keys inside the object represent mod IDs to be aliased. The value can be either a single **string**, or an **array** in case
  we want to provide multiple aliases for one mod.

### Hiding Forge mods' presence

Fabric mods tend to integrate with others based on their modid. If you happen to install a Forge version of a mod that
a Fabric mod wants to integrate with, it might result in a crash, as the two versions' code is different.
Most of the time, mods provide toggles for integrations in their config. If that's not the case, your other option is
hiding the Forge mod's presence from Fabric mods entirely, which might help in disabling the problematic integration.

This can be configured in the `connector.json` file, located in your config folder.
If it doesn't exist yet, Connector will create a new one with empty values.

Inside, the `hiddenMods` field is defined as a list of mod IDs (strings). Forge mod IDs found in this list will be
excluded from being added to `FabricLoader`, hiding their presence from Fabric mods.

Here's a minimal configuration example:
```json
{
  "hiddenMods": [
    "examplemod"
  ]
}
```

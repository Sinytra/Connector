**Sinytra Connector** is a translation/compatibility layer that allows running [Fabric](https://fabricmc.net/) mods on [NeoForge](https://neoforged.net/).
Its goal is to bring the two platforms closer together, saving developers time and effort maintaining their mods for multiple platforms at once,
as well as allowing players to play all their favourite mods in one modpack.

## üì¶ Installation

<Callout>
    Do not download the original Fabric API, as it's substitued by the **Forgified Fabric API**.
</Callout>

Connector's installation procedure follows the standard steps used for installing Minecraft mods.
It runs on the NeoForge mod loader and depends only on the Forgified Fabric API. If you're not familiar with this
process, we've listed the exact steps below:

1. Install NeoForge. We recommend using the latest stable version.
2. Download the latest release of Connector and drop the jar in your mods folder.
3. Following that, you'll want to download the [**Forgified Fabric API**](https://modrinth.com/mod/forgified-fabric-api).
It is meant to be a direct *replacement* for the Fabric API and is not compatible with it. We'll try our best to avoid
loading the Fabric API if it's installed automatically (e.g. by your modpack manager), but if you have the option to do
so, don't install it.

üéâ With all the steps completed, you're good to go! With all dependencies installed, grab your favourite Fabric mods
and just **drop them in the mods folder** like you would with any NeoForge mods. Connector will handle loading them for
you with no additional steps required.

## üîç Help and Support

<Callout variant="danger">
    Please don't report issues encountered while using Connector to mod authors, as it only puts unnecessary strain on
    their management.
    Fixing mod issues is our duty alone, and we'll happily look into them for you.

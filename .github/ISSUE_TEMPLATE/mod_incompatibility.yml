        ### 📋 Checklist
        Thank you for taking your time to report this bug!  
        Before reporting, please ensure that:
        - You are using the **latest** available version of Connector and its dependencies
        - You've installed a **minimal set of mods** required to reproduce the issue. 
          Issues with modpacks and excessive amount of mods will *not* be accepted, as they take a long time to diagnose.
          Knowing which mods are causing problems allows us to focus on fixing the issue as soon as possible.  
          If you're unsure which mods might be at fault, try using [binary search](https://www.reddit.com/r/feedthebeast/comments/evpy6r/tips_for_modpack_authors_how_to_find_misbehaving/) - removing half of installed mods
          repeatedly until the faulty mod is found.
        - The issue you're experience **doesn't occur** in a Fabric environment with the same mods installed
        
        > [!WARNING]
        > Note: Custom server APIs (such as Mohist, Magma, Arclight) are **not supported**.
        > This also applies to launchers for mobile platforms (Pojav, FoldCraft).

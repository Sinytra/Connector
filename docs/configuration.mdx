title: Configuring Connector
hide_meta: true
---

Connector offers multiple utility configuration options for improving mod compatibility on its platform.
These are found in the `config/connector.json` file relative to your root minecraft directory. If the file doesn't exist,
Connector will generate one with the default configuration options. Each of these options is explained in detail below.

```json filename="connector.json"
{
    "version": 1,
    "hiddenMods": [],
    "globalModAliases": {}
}
```

## Global Mod Aliases

To improve mod compatibility, Connector provides a Global Mod Alias feature that can be used to provide alternative IDs
for mods in the Fabric Loader.

Aliases can be defined in the `globalModAliases` field of Connector's config file. This JSON object contains all of our aliases for various mods.
Keys inside the object represent mod IDs to be aliased. The value can be either a single `string`, or an `array` in case we want to provide
multiple aliases for one mod.

<Callout>
  Connector provides certain default aliases for popular mods to improve its user experience. These are added to the default configuration file, but
  can be manually removed if necessary.

Here's a minimal configuration example:
```json filename="connector.json"
{
    "globalModAliases": {
        "cloth_config": "cloth-config2",
        "embeddium": [
            "sodium",
            "magnesium"
        ]
    }
}
```

## Hiding Forge mods' presence

Fabric mods tend to integrate with others based on their mod ID. If you happen to install a Forge version of a mod that a Fabric mod wants to integrate
with, it might result in a crash, as the two versions' code is different. Most of the time, mods provide toggles for integrations in their config.
If that's not the case, your other option is hiding the Forge mod's presence from Fabric mods entirely, which might help in disabling the problematic
integration.

Inside the Connector configuration file, the `hiddenMods` field is defined as an `array` of mod IDs (`string`s).
Forge mod IDs found in this list will be excluded from being added to Fabric Loader, resulting in their presence being hidden from Fabric mods.

Here's a minimal configuration example:
```json filename="connector.json"
{
    "hiddenMods": [
        "examplemod"
    ]
}
```

## Dependency Overrides

Connector supports Fabric Loader's [Dependency Overrides](https://fabricmc.net/wiki/tutorial:dependency_overrides) configuration file
out of the box without any change in its behaviour. All necessary information regarding this config can be found on the Fabric Wiki.

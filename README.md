## About

Sinytra Connector is a translation/compatibility layer that allows running [Fabric](https://fabricmc.net) mods
on [MinecraftForge](https://minecraftforge.net). Its goal is to bring the two platforms closer together, saving
developers time and effort maintaining their mods for multiple platforms at once, as well as allowing players to play
all their favourite mods in one modpack.

#### Resources

- Visit the [Mod Compatibility Thread](https://github.com/Sinytra/Connector/discussions/12) to can find information about known working / incompatible mods
- To learn more about how Connector works, read our [Introductory blog post](https://github.com/Sinytra/Connector/discussions/11)
- You may also like the [Forgified Fabric API](https://github.com/Sinytra/ForgifiedFabricAPI), a port of the Fabric API to Forge
- Check out [Connector Extras](https://github.com/Sinytra/ConnectorExtras) for an improved experience
  and better compatibility with third-party APIs

## Usage Guide

### Players

To install Connector and its dependencies, follow the same installation steps as you would for any other mods:

1. If you haven't already, install MinecraftForge. For minecraft 1.20.1, please use Forge version **`47.1.3`**. 
2. Get the latest release from one of our official distribution channels and drop the jar in your mods folder.
    - [CurseForge](https://legacy.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/sinytra-connector)
    - [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/connector)
    - [GitHub](https://github.com/Sinytra/Connector/releases)
3. Following that, you'll want to download the [**Forgified Fabric API**](https://github.com/Sinytra/ForgifiedFabricAPI).
   It is meant to be a direct *replacement* for the Fabric API and
   is not compatible with it. We'll try our best to avoid loading the Fabric API if it's installed automatically (e.g.
   by your modpack manager), but if you have the option to do so, don't install it. The Forgified Fabric API is
   available fo download on the following platforms:
    - [CurseForge](https://legacy.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/forgified-fabric-api)
    - [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/forgified-fabric-api)
    - [GitHub](https://github.com/Sinytra/ForgifiedFabricAPI/releases/latest)
4. Now that you have all dependencies installed, grab your favourite Fabric mods and
   **just drop them in the mods folder** like you would with any Forge mods. Connector will handle loading them for you
   with no additional steps required.

### Developers

For when you want to run Fabric mods in your Forge dev environment.
Connector can currently run in developer environments with a few additional requirements:

1. You need to have [MixinGradle](https://github.com/SpongePowered/MixinGradle) installed for mixins to be remapped
   properly.
2. Fabric mods must be in `intermediary` mappings.

#### Gradle Usage

```groovy
repositories {
    maven {
        name = "Sinytra"
        url = "https://maven.su5ed.dev/releases"
    }
}
dependencies {
    implementation fg.deobf("dev.su5ed.sinytra:Connector:<version>")
}
```

## Get help

If you're having trouble running a mod on Connector, ask us
on [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/Sinytra/Connector/discussions) or open an issue in this repository.

Here's a few tips to follow when reporting issues:

1. Make sure you are using latest available version. Look for existing issues that might've already been answered /
   fixed. Think about whether the issue is caused by Connector itself and not another mod you've installed. To test
   this, try reproducing the same issue on Fabric.
2. Navigate to [the issues tab](https://github.com/Sinytra/Connector/issues) and open
   a [new issue](https://github.com/Sinytra/Connector/issues/new/choose). Select one of the available templates
   depending on the topic. Fill in the required fields. In order to increase our chances of identifying and reproducing
   the issue, please make sure to include as many details as possible.
3. Once you're done describing the problem, submit the issue. We'll get to you as soon as we can.

Please note that providing as many details as possible is crucial to help us find and resolve the issue faster, while
also getting you a fixed version ASAP.
